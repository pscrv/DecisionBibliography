                a change in the physical environment in as much as a physical entity (the information stored as

                decision in case T 208/84 (VICOM, OJ EPO 1987, 14) more in particular paragraph 5 thereof. There 
                it was stated that "..., if a mathematical method is used in a technical process, that process 
                is carried out on a physical entity (which may be a material object but equally an image stored 
                as an electric signal) by some technical means... and provides as its result a certain change in 
                that entity". It is clear from the context of the citation that the expression "physical entity" 
                referred to a real thing i.e. an image, even if that thing was represented by an electric signal. 
                The electric signals processed according to the present application are not of this kind but

                to be abstracted) but derives therefrom a new information to be stored. Apart from that, it

                possessed. The information that was extracted from the reaction value data generated a result, i.e. 
                the genotype determination, which described this physical character. This was clearly technical in nature.""",

                sequence of nucleotides was contained in a particular sample. In steps B to E, the data represented 
                by the reaction values were processed to determine the genotype at the locus in the sample. This
